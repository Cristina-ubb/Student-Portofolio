        <p>
            I am a 2<sup>nd</sup> year student at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Cluj-Napoca, department of Mathematics and Computer Science taught in English. I describe myself as a driven, goal oriented person. Always looking for new opportunities to learn and evolve.   
        </p>

        <p>
            As a beginner, the most important applications I developed were school projects and extracurricular small projects, but I feel prepared for any new challenge. One of my biggest achievement so far is that I finished in the first year in top 5 in my department, winning a scholarship.
